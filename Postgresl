Figuring out locks
https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Lock_Monitoring

SELECT a.datname,
         l.relation::regclass,
         l.transactionid,
         l.mode,
         l.GRANTED,
         a.usename,
         a.query,
         a.pid
FROM pg_stat_activity a
JOIN pg_locks l ON l.pid = a.pid
ORDER BY a.pid;

An insert can block a select query , if there is a foreign join relation
for not key update postgresql, this tells us to give the lock but lets postgresql that we won't update the primary key. This usually works when a table's pk is referenced by another table as a fk.
