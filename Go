GoRoot has to point to the place you installed go.
GoPath you needs to point to your workspace

// go build

For an executable (Program):
Build the file
Reports any error , if any 
If no errors , puts an executable into the folder throws away the binary

// go install

For an executable
Compiles the program
Names the executable the folder holding the code
Puts the executable in workspace/bin
$GOPATH/bin
Then you can tun the code from anywhere in the terminal by just typing the package name

For a package compiles 
Puts the executable in workspace/pkg


./01_helloWorld to run an executable


In your .bash_profile.
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin


For anything to be executable it needs package main and a func main() method
Folder name and the package declaration of the package inside the file have to be the same

Functions which begin with lower case letters are not exported outside the.Only upper case case ones are exported outside the package 
Exported / unexported

// Executable 
Letâ€™s create an executable package. As we know, to create a binary executable file, we need our program to be a part of main package and it must have main function which is entry point of execution.
