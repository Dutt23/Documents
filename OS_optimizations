Complete Network Performance Improvements Summary
Here's a comprehensive overview of all the network optimizations we discussed:

1. TCP Buffer Optimization
Core Buffer Settings
bash
# Maximum socket buffer sizes
net.core.rmem_max=134217728          # 128MB max receive buffer
net.core.wmem_max=134217728          # 128MB max send buffer

# TCP auto-tuning ranges (min, default, max)  
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="4096 262144 16777216"    # Receive buffers (16MB max)
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="4096 262144 16777216"    # Send buffers (16MB max)
net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf=1              # Enable auto-tuning
Key Concept: BDP (Bandwidth-Delay Product) = Bandwidth × RTT determines minimum buffer size needed for full link utilization.

2. Window Scaling and Advanced TCP Features
Window Management
bash
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=1        # Enable windows > 64KB (auto-calculates scale)
net.ipv4.tcp_sack=1                  # Selective acknowledgments for efficient loss recovery
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=1            # Better RTT measurement
Key Concept: Window scaling allows TCP windows up to 1GB instead of 64KB limit, essential for high-BDP connections.

3. Congestion Control
Modern Algorithms
bash
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr  # Bandwidth-based (vs loss-based cubic)
net.ipv4.tcp_init_cwnd=20           # Faster connection start
net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle=0 # Don't reset after idle periods
Key Concept: BBR vs CUBIC - BBR probes actual bandwidth/RTT instead of waiting for packet loss.

4. Connection Management
Efficiency Settings
bash
net.core.somaxconn=8192              # More pending connections
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=15          # Faster cleanup (vs 60s default)
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=2              # Reuse TIME_WAIT sockets for outbound
net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=3              # Skip handshake overhead
Key Concept: TIME_WAIT sockets - connections in waiting state for 60s after close; reuse helps with port exhaustion.

5. Packet Processing (NAPI)
Softirq Optimization
bash
net.core.netdev_budget=600           # Packets per softirq run
net.core.netdev_budget_usecs=4000    # Max time per softirq run  
net.core.netdev_max_backlog=5000     # Backlog queue size
Key Concept: Softirq backlogs - kernel queues that can become bottlenecks during high packet rates.

6. NIC-Level Optimization
Hardware Settings
bash
# Ring buffer sizing
ethtool -G eth0 rx 4096 tx 4096

# Hardware offloads
ethtool -K eth0 gro on               # Generic Receive Offload
ethtool -K eth0 tso on               # TCP Segmentation Offload

# Multi-queue
ethtool -L eth0 combined 8           # Match CPU cores
7. Application-Specific Tuning
High BDP Service (Cloud Data Aggregation)
bash
# Large buffers for throughput
net.core.rmem_max=134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="4096 262144 16777216"
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle=0

# Higher processing budgets
net.core.netdev_budget=600
net.core.netdev_max_backlog=5000
REST API Service (Latency-focused)
bash
# Moderate buffers
net.core.rmem_max=16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="4096 87380 16777216"

# Fast connections
net.ipv4.tcp_init_cwnd=20
net.core.somaxconn=8192
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=15
net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=3
8. Key Concepts Explained
Buffer Bloat vs Proper Buffering
Bufferbloat = Network devices with excessive buffering and no flow control

Proper server buffers = TCP flow control prevents bloat via window management

Flow Control vs Congestion Control
Flow control = Receiver tells sender about buffer space (TCP window)

Congestion control = Sender detects network congestion (packet loss)

SACK (Selective Acknowledgments)
Problem: Traditional TCP retransmits everything after a gap

Solution: SACK tells sender exactly which packets are missing

Benefit: Massive efficiency gain during packet loss scenarios

BDP Classification
Low BDP (< 64KB): Local networks, default settings work

Medium BDP (64KB-1MB): Internet connections, light tuning helps

High BDP (> 1MB): Long-distance high-speed links, heavy tuning required

9. Monitoring Commands
Check Current Settings
bash
ss -i                    # Per-connection windows and congestion state
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_*    # Current TCP settings
ethtool -g eth0          # Ring buffer sizes
Monitor Performance
bash
# Softirq backlogs and drops  
awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) printf strtonum("0x" $i) (i==NF?"\n":" ")}' /proc/net/softnet_stat

# Network statistics
nstat -az | grep -i retrans    # Retransmissions
iftop                          # Real-time bandwidth usage
10. The Complete Optimization Strategy
Calculate your BDP = Bandwidth × RTT

Size buffers appropriately ≥ BDP for throughput, reasonable max for memory

Enable modern features (window scaling, SACK, timestamps, BBR)

Tune for workload (high-throughput vs low-latency)

Monitor and adjust based on actual performance metrics

The key insight: Network performance optimization is about matching buffer sizes to network characteristics (BDP), enabling efficient loss recovery (SACK), and using modern congestion control algorithms (BBR) while avoiding resource waste.




CPU Affinity and Interrupt Optimization
IRQ (Interrupt) Affinity
bash
# Check current interrupt assignments
cat /proc/interrupts | grep eth0

# Pin network interrupts to specific CPUs
echo 2 > /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity        # Pin IRQ 24 to CPU 1 (binary: 10)
echo f > /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity        # Pin to CPUs 0-3 (binary: 1111)

# Or use CPU list format
echo 1 > /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity_list   # Pin to CPU 1
echo 0-3 > /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity_list # Pin to CPUs 0-3
RSS (Receive Side Scaling)
bash
# Enable multiple RX queues to distribute across CPUs
ethtool -L eth0 combined 8               # 8 queues for 8 CPU cores
ethtool -x eth0                          # Show current RSS configuration

# Configure RSS hash fields
ethtool -N eth0 rx-flow-hash tcp4 sdfn   # Use src/dst IP and ports for hashing
RPS (Receive Packet Steering)
bash
# When hardware RSS isn't available, use software steering
echo f > /sys/class/net/eth0/queues/rx-0/rps_cpus  # CPUs 0-3 handle RX queue 0

# Set RPS flow limit
echo 4096 > /proc/sys/net/core/rps_sock_flow_entries
echo 2048 > /sys/class/net/eth0/queues/rx-0/rps_flow_cnt
XPS (Transmit Packet Steering)
bash
# Ensure TX happens on same CPU as RX for cache efficiency
echo f > /sys/class/net/eth0/queues/tx-0/xps_cpus  # CPUs 0-3 handle TX queue 0
Application Thread Affinity
bash
# Pin your application to specific CPUs
taskset -c 4-7 your-application          # Run app on CPUs 4-7

# Or set CPU affinity programmatically
numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1 your-application  # NUMA-aware binding
CPU Affinity Strategy by Workload
High-Throughput Service (Your Cloud Aggregation)
bash
# Dedicated CPU layout:
# CPUs 0-1: Network interrupts and softirq
# CPUs 2-3: Kernel network processing  
# CPUs 4-7: Application threads

# Network interrupts on CPUs 0-1
echo 3 > /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity_list

# RSS across CPUs 0-3
ethtool -L eth0 combined 4
echo f > /sys/class/net/eth0/queues/rx-0/rps_cpus

# Application on CPUs 4-7
taskset -c 4-7 your-cloud-service
REST API Service (Many Connections)
bash
# Spread interrupts across more CPUs for better connection handling
# CPUs 0-3: Network processing
# CPUs 4-7: Application threads

echo 0-3 > /proc/irq/24/smp_affinity_list
ethtool -L eth0 combined 4
taskset -c 4-7 your-api-service
NUMA Awareness
Check NUMA Topology
bash
numactl --hardware                       # Show NUMA nodes
lscpu | grep NUMA                       # CPU-to-NUMA mapping
cat /sys/class/net/eth0/device/numa_node # Which NUMA node has the NIC
NUMA-Optimized Settings
bash
# If NIC is on NUMA node 0, pin everything to node 0
numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 your-application

# Set network buffers on same NUMA node as NIC
echo 0 > /proc/irq/24/numa_affinity
Why CPU Affinity Matters
Performance Benefits
Cache locality: Keep packet processing on same CPU to avoid cache misses

Reduced lock contention: Less CPU-to-CPU synchronization overhead

Better scaling: Distribute load evenly across cores

Reduced jitter: Consistent processing on dedicated CPUs

Common Problems Without Affinity
Cache bouncing: Packets processed on different CPUs lose cache benefits

CPU overload: All interrupts hitting one CPU while others idle

False sharing: Multiple CPUs accessing same cache lines

NUMA penalties: Cross-NUMA memory access adding latency

Monitoring CPU Affinity
Check Interrupt Distribution
bash
watch "cat /proc/interrupts | grep eth0"  # See which CPUs handle interrupts
mpstat -P ALL 1                          # Per-CPU utilization
Application CPU Usage
bash
top -H -p $(pgrep your-application)       # Per-thread CPU usage
taskset -p $(pgrep your-application)      # Check current CPU affinity
Complete Optimization Checklist
Now the complete network optimization includes:

TCP Buffers → Size for BDP

Window Scaling → Enable large windows

Congestion Control → Use BBR

Connection Management → Fast setup/teardown

Packet Processing → NAPI tuning

NIC Settings → Ring buffers, offloads

CPU Affinity → Pin interrupts and threads strategically ← This was missing!

NUMA Optimization → Keep processing local to NIC

CPU affinity is crucial - without it, all other optimizations can be undermined by poor CPU scheduling and cache performance! Thanks for catching that omission.
